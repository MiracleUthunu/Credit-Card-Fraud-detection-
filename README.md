Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project focuses on predicting fraudulent activities in financial transactions. By analyzing transactional data and user behavior patterns, the system aims to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, thus minimizing financial losses.

Dataset
The dataset comprises transactional information, including transaction amount, time, location, and user demographics. Additionally, it contains labeled data indicating whether each transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Prediction Model
We employ machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, Random Tree Classifier, to build a predictive model. This model leverages features extracted from the dataset to detect potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering.
Model Training: Train the prediction model using the preprocessed dataset.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy

How to Contribute
Contributions to enhance the prediction model's accuracy, optimize detection algorithms, or improve documentation are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
